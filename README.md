# Uncle Spufus v1.5
A tool that automates MAC address spoofing

## What is Uncle Spufus
# My long story
I remember back in the days when i used macchanger to spoof my MAC address. It would show
that the MAC address was successfully changed. However as soon i connected to wifi network the MAC address
reverted back to the original MAC. I discovered that by accident meaning that those guys who blindly trust
tools would continue to do stuff thinking "Yay! i am using a spoofed MAC Address", but in reality they
were using their original MAC!.

# In short
Uncle spufus uses macchanger however it checks that the MAC is successfully spoofed after connecting to 
a network. It will always fail if a MAC reverts back to the original after connecting to a network. It
tries some well known techniques to spoof your MAC. When it finds the one thats working it saves that
technique for future use.


# Requirements

* macchanger
* bash
